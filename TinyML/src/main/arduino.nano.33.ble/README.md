# MicroSpeech
Main is `main_speech.ino`.

- See output command in `arduino_command_responder.cpp`.
- See in there how to do something smart, how to respond to the `WANTED_WORDS`...

Look for `WANTED_WORDS` in the Jupyter notebooks (training model).

> Note: If the Arduino Nana 33 BLE is stuck in upload mode, double-click on the `reset` button.
