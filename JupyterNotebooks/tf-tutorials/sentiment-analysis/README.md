# Define, Train, Serve
### The full process
Based on the [TensorFlow text_classification sample](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/keras/text_classification.ipynb#scrollTo=GH4_2ZGJsa_X).

#### Define and Train
The notebook `Oliv's_copy_of_text_classification.ipynb` is to be uploaded 
on [ColabNet](https://colab.research.google.com/) (in _your_ drive), where you will have all the required components already installed in
their right versions, along with powerful machines and processors. 

At the end of the notebook, after being defined, trained, and tested, the model is archived into a zip named
`model.zip`, which you can then download.

#### Reuse the model, Serve
Upload the Notebook `LoadingModel.ipynb` as you did before for the other Notebook.

Then, upload the `model.zip` that was previously downloaded.
> _Note:_ you could also save that archive on somewhere on the web, and download it from its URL, as did for the 
> datasets used in the previous Notebook.
