## [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), also for Java
Emergence of AI and Deep Learning contributed to the popularity of the Jupyter Notebooks.

Notebooks contain **_executable_** code (<u>yes</u>, you can execute the code of a Notebook in real time), possibly (extensively) commented and illustrated.
They can be re-played or just read or seen as they were after their last execution.

As `markdown` language is supported, they can contain whatever `md` syntax supports, images, url, graphics, tables, etc.
As such, graphical data representation can be used. And in the Deep Learning space, they are, indeed.

Notebooks are ideal for tutorials, hence (a part of) their success.

Notebooks are not only for Python (as they were at the very beginning), they also supports _**many**_ other languages!
The main requirement being to have a `REPL` (**R**ead **E**valuate **P**rint **L**oop).

Java 9 comes with a `REPL` (called `JShell`).

To install Java 9 on the Raspberry Pi, see [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=200232). 
> Note: Some restrictions may apply, the Raspberry Pi Zero might not like it.

<!-- sudo apt-get remove ca-certificates-java -->
> April 2019: Still having problems to install JDK 9 on a Raspberry Pi B3+ ... Certificate stuff.
> But all the features described here can be run on a system where Java 9 is happy.

> Aug 2019: The last Raspbian version (Buster) comes with Java 11. All is fixed.

Install Jupyter on the Raspberry Pi is easy:
```
 $ sudo pip3 install jupyter
```
or
```
sudo su -
apt-get update
apt-get install python3-matplotlib
apt-get install python3-scipy
pip3 install --upgrade pip
reboot
sudo pip3 install jupyter
sudo apt-get clean
```
> See also the [Jupyter Installation](https://jupyter.org/install) guide.

To add the required Java features, see

- <https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava>
- <https://hub.mybinder.org/user/spencerpark-ijava-binder-ey9zwplq/notebooks/3rdPartyDependency.ipynb>

> I installed it from the source (the its `git` repo).
>
> Note: To install the Java kernel, make sure `jupyter` and related commands are in the `$PATH` of your session.

### Raspberry-Coffee Notebooks

Will provide examples as notebooks, for the features presented in this project.

From this directory (_here_, right where this file you're reading is), just run
```
 $ jupyter notebook
```
or more recently
```
 $ jupyter-notebook
```
And from a browser anywhere on the network of the Raspberry Pi, `raspberry-pi` being the name or address of the Raspberry Pi where the notebook server is running, reach `http://raspberry-pi:8888/tree` to start playing!
 
> Note: You can run the above wherever you have installed `jupyter`, on a Raspberry PI, on a Linux laptop, on a Windows box, etc.
> If you are in a graphical environment, `Jupyter` might even be smart enough to display its home page in your default browser.  
 
Come back here soon.
