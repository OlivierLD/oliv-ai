## Summary of the Python scripts
- `sample.01.py` Continuous Camera Capture, NO PROCESSING.
- `sample.05.1.py`
    - Will use images from the training data set to evaluate the digits it represents
- `sample.05.2.py`
    - Similar to `sample.05.1.py`, but with YOUR own images.
    - Model `training.h5` must already exist
    - Uses OpenCV to reshape the images as expected by the model
- `sample.05.2.save.py`
- `sample.05.3.py`
    - Synopsis:
        - Enter digit images to compose number A
        - Enter operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
        - Enter digit images to compose number B
        - Enter `=` to get the result
    - Model `training.h5` must already exist (generated by `sample.05.2.save.py`).
    - Use images from training or test dataset.
- `sample.05.21.py`
    - Similar to `sample.05.1.py`, but with _YOUR_ own images, read from the camera in real time.
    - **Model `training.h5` must already exist** (generated by `sample.05.2.save.py`).
    - Uses OpenCV to read and reshape the images as expected by the model
        - ![Setting](../img/settings.jpg)
        - Show an hand-written character to the camera
        - Hit `S` to have it recognized
        - More details [here](../README.md#your-own-hand-written-digits-recognition).
- `sample.05.21.py`, WIP
    - Reads a string of several digits, and speaks the result.
- `convnet/sample.01.py`
    - Digits recognition, Model training with a Convolutional Network (aka convnet)
    - Model can be saved from here too.
- `sample.06.py`
    - Images recognition, like dresses, shirts, shoes, etc.
- `python.scratch/several_digits.py`
    - Splitting a multi-digit hand-written number into specific characters (for recognition, see `sample.05.21.py`)
- `sample.07.01.py` Hand and fingers detection (WIP)
